# USSD-node-js

Good question üëç ‚Äî right now the code in your wallet app is just a backend API. To make it actually work as a USSD service, you need to connect it to your mobile network operator‚Äôs USSD gateway. Let me break it down clearly:

üîó How to Link Node.js App to USSD

1. Get Access to a USSD Code

A USSD code looks like *123# or *456*9#.

Only the mobile network operator (MNO) can issue these codes.

You‚Äôll request a short code from your company‚Äôs USSD/Value Added Services (VAS) team.

They can give you a dedicated short code (*123#) or a shared code (e.g., *123*45# where 45 is your service ID).




---

2. Connect to the USSD Gateway

The MNO has a USSD Gateway that routes customer dial requests (*123#) to your backend app.
Usually, they forward requests via:

HTTP (most common) ‚Üí They hit your API endpoint (e.g., POST https://yourapp.com/ussd).

SMPP or SS7 ‚Üí More telco-heavy protocols (you‚Äôd need middleware, but often not necessary).


So for your Node.js app:

Expose an endpoint /ussd.

The operator will configure their gateway to forward USSD sessions to that URL.

3. Handle USSD Requests

The USSD gateway sends requests like this (format depends on the operator):

{
  "sessionId": "xyz123",
  "phoneNumber": "254712345678",
  "text": "1*200*0712345678",
  "networkCode": "62101"
}

sessionId: Unique per session (*123# dial until user exits).

phoneNumber: The user‚Äôs MSISDN (their number).

text: The input typed by user, separated by *.


Your backend (the Node.js wallet you built) processes this text and returns a menu string.


---

4. Respond Back to User

Response format is usually plain text with CON or END:

CON ‚Üí Continue session (user will see next menu).

END ‚Üí End session.


Example:

CON Welcome to MyWallet
1. Check Balance
2. Send Money
3. Mini Statement

If the user chooses 1:

END Your balance is 1,200 KES


---

5. Deployment

Host your Node.js app on a server with public HTTPS (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Render, DigitalOcean).

Provide the callback URL (e.g., https://mywallet.com/ussd) to your company‚Äôs USSD/VAS team.

They‚Äôll bind the short code (*123#) to that URL.



---

‚úÖ So in short:

1. Get a short code from your network operator.


2. They‚Äôll point it to your Node.js /ussd API endpoint.


3. Parse requests, manage menus, and reply with CON/END.


4. Integrate with your wallet logic (the MongoDB balance system we built).

Do you want me to extend your Node.js code so it can handle actual USSD requests (menu navigation with CON/END), so once your company gives you the short code, you can plug it in directly?
